# Object-oriented programming
    I created user objects that are resonsible for storing most of the important data in this program
# Inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
    I used inheritance by having my MultiPanel class extend Jframe, therefore inheriting it. I used encapsulation throughout my program with the user objects
# Sound programming practices
    I attempted to keep my style/spacing consistent throughout the program, while also attempting to think about the most efficent way of doing things. at least the most efficent way that I understood. There were a few parts of my program that are hard coded, for example creating all of the checklists for all 155 champions, but I tried to do this in more efficent ways but I could not use the checkboxes in the action listeners Like I can since I hard-coded them all in.
# Solid documentation including (but not limited to) UML diagrams
    All of my documentation includes a algorithm, a UML, a small usecase analysis/gui diagram, and this conclusion piece
# Proper implementation of Abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes)
    I implemented abstract classes throughout my program by implementing the ActionListener interface and implementing the Serializable interface
# Appropriate use of data structures (linked lists, stacks, arraylists)
    All of the data is stored in indivdual user objects, the user objects contain a linked list of owned champions, along with multiple arrays containing general League of Legends information
